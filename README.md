# Image Processing and Computer Vision (IPCV) Exam Projects

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and associated code developed for the practical part of the Image Processing and Computer Vision (IPCV) exam (First Year, Artificial Intelligence curriculum, University of Bologna - Unibo).

## Goal 
These projects focus on implementing and comparing classic and deep learning approaches for two computer vision tasks: Instance Detection and Image Classification.

## Repository Structure 
The repository is organized into two main project folders, corresponding to the required assignments:

|Folder|Project Title|Description|
|------|-------------|-----------|
|assignment1 | Instance Detection: Bookshelf |Implementation of a model (e.g., using classical techniques or deep learning) to perform instance detection of individual books on a bookshelf. The goal is to locate and precisely bound each book instance.|
|assignment2|Image Classification: Stanford Dogs| Classification of dog breeds using the Stanford Dogs Dataset. This project involves two main approaches: 1. Custom Network: Designing and training a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch. 2. Transfer Learning: Adapting and fine-tuning the pre-trained ResNet18 model.|
